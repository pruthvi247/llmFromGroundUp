    "# üî¨ Lab Introduction: Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools‚Äîsuch as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you‚Äôll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML‚Äîlaying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "Radio observations of recurrent novae have provided valuable insights into the dynamics and composition of these intriguing astrophysical phenomena. Several studies highlight the various characteristics and behaviors of recurrent novae through different outbursts. Below is a summary of notable findings from recent research:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Findings from Recent Research\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Review of Recurrent Novae**:\n",
      "   - In a comprehensive review by Koji Mukai, it is noted that recurrent novae eruptions are often intensely observed across a broad spectrum, from radio to X-rays. A specific case, T Pyxidis (T Pyx), demonstrates a complex ejection of nova envelopes, suggesting that the envelope ejection in both recurrent and classical novae is a more intricate process than traditionally described [Mukai, 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **2011 Outburst of T Pyx**:\n",
      "   - Radio observations during the 2011 outburst of T Pyx, conducted with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, revealed peculiarities like a delayed rise in radio flux, suggesting a massive ejection significantly higher than typical values for recurrent novae. This implies that the ejecta mass was substantial, projecting insights into the mechanisms of mass ejection in such systems [Nelson et al., 2012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3112v2).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Multiwavelength Analysis of V745 Sco**:\n",
      "   - A study involving the recurrent nova V745 Sco highlights the observation of high-energy gamma-rays and early shocks, which indicate particle acceleration during the nova explosions. Such multiwavelength analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of the early evolution of nova ejecta and their interactions with surrounding stellar material [Delgado & Hernanz, 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08940v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Synchrotron Emission in V3890 Sagitarii**:\n",
      "   - Research on V3890 Sagitarii observed synchrotron emissions produced by the nova ejecta interacting with the wind from a companion star. Early radio detections increase understanding of shock interactions and mass-loss rates, suggesting contributions to our comprehension of potential supernovae progenitors [Nyamai et al., 2023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09116v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **X-ray Emission Observations**:\n",
      "   - An analysis of 108 classical and recurrent novae observed with ROSAT indicated that most novae emit hard X-rays, likely due to shocks in the nova ejecta. Such emissions provide insight into the shock processes post-outburst and the conditions leading to potential super-soft X-ray sources [Orio et al., 2001](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104219v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The wide range of observations across different wavelengths, including radio, have greatly enriched our understanding of recurrent novae. Studies underscore the complexity of these stellar explosions, from the mass ejection processes to their role as potential precursors to supernovae. Continued radio observations remain crucial for unraveling the intricate processes governing these captivating cosmic events.\n",

       "    <h3>1. Review of Recurrent Novae</h3>\n",
       "    <p>In a comprehensive review by Mukai (2014), recurrent novae eruptions are extensively analyzed across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to X-rays. The case of T Pyxidis (T Pyx) illustrates the complex nature of nova envelope ejection, suggesting that both recurrent and classical novae exhibit more intricate ejection processes than previously understood. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526v1\">[Mukai, 2014]</a></p>\n",
       "\n",
       "    <h3>2. 2011 Outburst of T Pyx</h3>\n",
       "    <p>Radio observations during the 2011 outburst of T Pyx, conducted with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, revealed a delayed rise in radio flux. This phenomenon suggests a substantial mass ejection, exceeding typical values for recurrent novae. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing mass ejection in such systems. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3112v2\">[Nelson et al., 2012]</a></p>\n",
       "\n",
       "    <h3>3. Multiwavelength Analysis of V745 Sco</h3>\n",
       "    <p>A study of the recurrent nova V745 Sco highlights the detection of high-energy gamma rays and early shocks, indicating particle acceleration during nova explosions. Such multiwavelength analyses enhance our understanding of the early evolution of nova ejecta and their interactions with surrounding stellar material. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08940v1\">[Delgado & Hernanz, 2019]</a></p>\n",
       "\n",
       "    <h3>4. Synchrotron Emission in V3890 Sagitarii</h3>\n",
       "    <p>Research on V3890 Sagitarii has documented synchrotron emissions resulting from the interaction of nova ejecta with the wind from a companion star. Early radio detections contribute to our understanding of shock interactions and mass-loss rates, thereby informing our knowledge of potential supernova progenitors. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09116v1\">[Nyamai et al., 2023]</a></p>\n",
       "\n",
       "    <h3>5. X-ray Emission Observations</h3>\n",
       "    <p>An analysis of 108 classical and recurrent novae observed with ROSAT indicates that most novae emit hard X-rays, likely due to shocks in the nova ejecta. These emissions offer valuable insights into the shock processes occurring post-outburst and the conditions that may lead to super-soft X-ray sources. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104219v1\">[Orio et al., 2001]</a></p>\n",
       "\n",
       "    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "    <p>The diverse observations across various wavelengths, particularly in the radio spectrum, have greatly enhanced our understanding of recurrent novae. These studies underscore the complexity of stellar explosions, from mass ejection processes to their potential role as precursors to supernovae. Continued radio observations are essential for unraveling the intricate processes governing these captivating cosmic events. Future research should focus on the implications of these findings for stellar evolution and the broader astrophysical context, potentially leading to new discoveries in the field.</p>\n",
