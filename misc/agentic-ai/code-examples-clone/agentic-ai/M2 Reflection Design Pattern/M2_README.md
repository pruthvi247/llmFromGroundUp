# ADP Module 2: Reflection Design Pattern

## Module summary
Explore the reflection design pattern, where AI systems critique and improve their outputs. This module discusses how reflection is applied, including possibilities like using AI to critique its reports. Although simpler than other design patterns, reflection demonstrates the potency of an agentic approach with practical illustrations, potentially involving tools that inject third-party knowledge to enhance reflection.

## Proposed videos
- Video 1: Reflection to improve outputs of a task
- Video 2: Reflection example 1: improving study flashcards
- Video 3: Reflection example 2: Improving a data visualization
- Video 4: Why not just one-shot prompting?
- Video 5: Reasoning vs general purpose models for reflection
- Video 6: Reflection for defensive strategies
- Video 7: Limitations of reflection only

## Proposed Activities

### flashcards_agent
Generate study flashcards from source text and improve them through LLM-based reflection and evaluation. Demonstrates iterative improvement by having one model critique another's work and refine the output based on pedagogical best practices.

### pii_removal
Protect personally identifiable information in healthcare AI systems using defensive reflection techniques. Shows how to detect and prevent prompt injection attacks that attempt to extract sensitive patient data from clinical assistants.

### sql_agent
Convert natural language questions into SQL queries and improve accuracy through reflection. Demonstrates how an agent can evaluate whether database query results properly answer user questions and refine queries iteratively.

### visualization_agent
Create data visualizations from natural language instructions and improve them through LLM-based critique. Shows how reflection can enhance chart quality, readability, and professional presentation through iterative refinement.
