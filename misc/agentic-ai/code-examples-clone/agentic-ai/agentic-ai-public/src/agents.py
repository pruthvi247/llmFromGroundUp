Output the complete report in Markdown format only. Do not include meta-commentary about the writing process.

INTERNAL CHECKLIST (DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUTPUT):
- [ ] Incorporated all provided research materials
- [ ] Developed original analysis beyond mere summarization
- [ ] Included all mandatory sections with appropriate content
- [ ] Used proper inline citations for all borrowed content
