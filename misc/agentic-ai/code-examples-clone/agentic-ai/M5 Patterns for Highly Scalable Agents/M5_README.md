# ADP Module 45: Multi-agent Collaboration

## Module summary
Examine how tasks can be divided across multiple agents to solve complex problems. Learners will study examples such as research agents with distinct roles (e.g., research, writing, critique), and learn design patterns related to agent communication, whether in linear sequences or concurrent dialogues, including the pros and cons of each approach.

## Proposed Activities

### customer-service
Multi-agent pipeline architecture featuring four specialized agents (Planner → Coder → Executor → Reflector) that collaborate sequentially to process customer requests for a sunglasses store. Demonstrates sequential orchestration with error recovery, where agents can invoke each other for fault-tolerant automation through modular task decomposition and self-correction capabilities.
